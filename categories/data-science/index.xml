      <description>This post presents my research proposal for my MSc thesis: &amp;ldquo;Predicting the rate of Acute Flaccid Paralysis in different settings to support polio surveillance and elimination&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;You will learn why non-polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis (NPAFP) is important in support of polio eradication. The current challenge involves interpreting the AFP indicator that exceed the targeted levels. Potential data sources and modelling methods are raised to fill this knowledge gap. Aim and Objectives Research Aim To investigate and model the mechanisms underlying the notification of the key polio surveillance indicator - NPAFP rates in endemic and outbreak settings.</description>

      <description>How do you apply time-to-event analysis to compare the impact of different prescriptions on death?&#xA;This article examines the survival function of two prescriptions using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models in an electronic health records (EHR) setting. EHR data are powerful real-world data. They are conducive to time-to-event analysis owing to the characteristic of sequential visits to primary and secondary care services. Take UK&amp;rsquo;s OpenSAFELY for instance, this secure, transparent, and open-source platform provides an Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for National Health Service (NHS) EHR data analysis, which supported urgent research into the COVID-19 emergency.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will explore the following topics:&#xA;Using regularized method (Lasso) for predictive variable selection Tuning hyperparameters for tree-based methods Employing the weighted sum of weak learners for boosted classifier Comparing prediction performances and predictors importance Basic Methods Inmagine you possess a dataset comprising 30 biomarker varaibles with 5000+. How would you use it to predict patient&amp;rsquo;s remission status, i.e. remission or active disease? One common approach that may cross your mind is the logistic regression, as illustrated below:</description>

      <description>What can you learn from this article?&#xA;Understand the concepts of data linkage, especially deterministic linakge. Address linkage error in the conjunction of MIMIC III (served in a postgreSQL database) and ODK database. Employ R to design the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline. Use Quarto document to generate a report in PDF format. Concepts of Data Linkage In a data scientist&amp;rsquo;s typical day, the merge/join function is an inevitable task.</description>

      <description>This year, London home rental prices hit record as demand outstriped supply, with the average tenant now being asked to pay a whopping Â£2,500 a month for a new let.&#xA;Within this rental market, individuals seeking short-term accommodations encounter greater challenges. My roommates and I was looking for a house/flat for co-renting with a 6-month tenancy, and we put in a significant effort throughout the entire month of August by searching and making inquiries about over 170 properties before finally settling down.</description>
