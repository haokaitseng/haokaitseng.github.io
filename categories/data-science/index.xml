      <description>How do you apply time-to-event analysis to compare the impact of different prescriptions on death?&#xA;This article examines the survival function of two prescriptions using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models in an electronic health records (EHR) setting. EHR data are powerful real-world data. They are conducive to time-to-event analysis owing to the characteristic of sequential visits to primary and secondary care services. Take UK&amp;rsquo;s OpenSAFELY for instance, this secure, transparent, and open-source platform provides an Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for National Health Service (NHS) EHR data analysis, which supported urgent research into the COVID-19 emergency.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will explore the following topics:&#xA;Using regularized method (Lasso) for predictive variable selection Tuning hyperparameters for tree-based methods Employing the weighted sum of weak learners for boosted classifier Comparing prediction performances and predictors importance Basic Methods Inmagine you possess a dataset comprising 30 biomarker varaibles with 5000+. How would you use it to predict patient&amp;rsquo;s remission status, i.e. remission or active disease? One common approach that may cross your mind is the logistic regression, as illustrated below:</description>

      <description>What can you learn from this article?&#xA;Understand the concepts of data linkage, especially deterministic linakge. Address linkage error in the conjunction of MIMIC III (served in a postgreSQL database) and ODK database. Employ R to design the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline. Use Quarto document to generate a report in PDF format. Concepts of Data Linkage In a data scientist&amp;rsquo;s typical day, the merge/join function is an inevitable task.</description>

      <description>This article delivers two key insights:&#xA;Advantages of applying UK GDPR in research planning. Five approaches to safeguard data protection in lung cancer patient interviews. Setting th Scene The need of assessing the Quality of Life (QoL) in patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy has been increasing. After treatment, patients may experience breathlessness or fatigue, along with potential challenges in their daily and occupational functioning. These side effects of chemotherapy consistently rank as a common complaint among patients.</description>
