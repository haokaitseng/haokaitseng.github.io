      <description>This post shares my poster presentation at the vaccine hesitancy course held by the Croucher Foundation in August, 2024, Hong Kong.&#xA;Download the poster =&amp;gt; Note that this post is still under construction&#xA;This poster is the milestone of my thesis project at LSHTM.&#xA;Introduction Global incidence of polio has decreased by 99%. Non-polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis (NPAFP) is the key indicator for the sensitivity of polio surveillance. While countries with circulating poliovirus consistently report NPAFP rates exceeding the gold standard, it is not well-understood what rate should be expected.</description>

      <description>This post presents my research proposal for my MSc thesis: &amp;ldquo;Predicting the rate of Acute Flaccid Paralysis in different settings to support polio surveillance and elimination&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;You will learn why non-polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis (NPAFP) is important in support of polio eradication. The current challenge involves interpreting the AFP indicator that exceed the targeted levels. Potential data sources and modelling methods are raised to fill this knowledge gap. Aim and Objectives Research Aim To investigate and model the mechanisms underlying the notification of the key polio surveillance indicator - NPAFP rates in endemic and outbreak settings.</description>

      <description>For poeple doing vaccination works, their world wareness day is not a single day - it&amp;rsquo;s a week, spanning from 24th to 30th April each year.&#xA;This year, WHO celebrate 50 years of the &amp;ldquo;Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;In LSHTM&amp;rsquo;s Vaccine Centre (VaC), our world immunisation week (WIW) topic this year is &amp;ldquo;responding to outbreaks&amp;rdquo;. We want to highlight the collective action needed to protect people from outbreaks and vaccine-preventable diseases.</description>

      <description>What can you learn from this article? An experimental cohort study design for policy evaluation, where countries made the move from a two-dose to single-dose schedule for national HPV vaccination programmes since 2023.&#xA;Introduction Since the first licensing of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2006, evidence has been emerging showing that single-dose schedules provide comparable efficacy to the conditional regimens, i.e. two or three doses. In 2022, a review of World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) concluded that a single-dose HPV vaccine delivers solid protection against HPV.</description>
