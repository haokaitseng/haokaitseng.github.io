      <description>This post presents my research proposal for my MSc thesis: &amp;ldquo;Predicting the rate of Acute Flaccid Paralysis in different settings to support polio surveillance and elimination&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;You will learn why non-polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis (NPAFP) is important in support of polio eradication. The current challenge involves interpreting the AFP indicator that exceed the targeted levels. Potential data sources and modelling methods are raised to fill this knowledge gap. Aim and Objectives Research Aim To investigate and model the mechanisms underlying the notification of the key polio surveillance indicator - NPAFP rates in endemic and outbreak settings.</description>

      <description>For poeple doing vaccination works, their world wareness day is not a single day - it&amp;rsquo;s a week, spanning from 24th to 30th April each year.&#xA;This year, WHO celebrate 50 years of the &amp;ldquo;Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;In LSHTM&amp;rsquo;s Vaccine Centre (VaC), our world immunisation week (WIW) topic this year is &amp;ldquo;responding to outbreaks&amp;rdquo;. We want to highlight the collective action needed to protect people from outbreaks and vaccine-preventable diseases.</description>

      <description>This group project is a collective effort, with contributions from my teammates Minn Thit Aung, Polly Nightingale, Simon Kent, and Xavier Dunn, listed alphabetically.&#xA;This post aims to:&#xA;Determine the the basic reproduction number (R0) of an hypothetical outbreak Assess the impact of various strategies for vaccination and school closures on accumulative cases and peak cases/timing Provide instructions for constructing a SEIR model using Berkeley Madonna Offer simple R code for converting a ggplot into a GIF Setting the Scene Many countries have recently experienced the first wave of an influenza pandemic caused by the strain HuNz.</description>

      <description>What can you learn from this article? An experimental cohort study design for policy evaluation, where countries made the move from a two-dose to single-dose schedule for national HPV vaccination programmes since 2023.&#xA;Introduction Since the first licensing of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2006, evidence has been emerging showing that single-dose schedules provide comparable efficacy to the conditional regimens, i.e. two or three doses. In 2022, a review of World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) concluded that a single-dose HPV vaccine delivers solid protection against HPV.</description>
